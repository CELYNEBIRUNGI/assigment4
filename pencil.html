            <h3>CARRER IN TECH </h3>
            <p>When you’re applying to work for a technology company, you need to show clear enthusiasm for 
              technology, even if you’re not applying for a technical role. This is because technology <br>companies want
               all their employees to be strong ambassadors for their products.

              And if you are applying for a technical role, it goes without saying that you need to have a
               passion for technological innovation.<br>
              
              You might be asked about your passion for technology in specific application 
              questions. IBM, for example, has previously asked applicants for all its schemes
               (including sales and business roles) to show how their skills and achievements point<br> towards a true
                interest in tech. If there is no specific question, you need to convince recruiters of your passion in 
                your answers to other
               application questions about why you want the job, or in your covering letter.

            <h3>Interest In Technology</h3>
            <p> I'm interested in a career in technology because I want to use my skills and knowledge to
               make other people's jobs easier and more <br>< I believe IT support
                technicians are important team members for any organization because they combine 
                technical knowledge with <br>
                interpersonal skills.
